    <h2>Cybersecurity Basics</h2>
    <p>Cybersecurity means protecting your computer, phone, and personal information from hackers or viruses. Always use strong passwords and keep your devices updated.</p>
    <div class="example">
      <strong>Example:</strong> Instead of using <code>password123</code>, try something stronger like <code>MyC@tEatsTacos!45</code>.
    <h2>Protecting Your Privacy</h2>
    <p>Your personal data, like your name, address, or photos, can be used by others if you share it online. Think before you post, and keep your accounts private when possible.</p>
    <h2>Online Scams</h2>
    <p>Scammers may try to trick you into clicking bad links or sharing your info. Always be careful when something looks suspicious or “too good to be true.”</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Don’t click random links in emails or texts.</li>
      <li>Ignore messages asking for money or personal details.</li>
      <li>Use antivirus software and keep it updated.</li>
    </ul>
