  <h1>How Does The Internet Work?</h1>
  <p>
    The Internet works by connecting different networks of computers through a system of routers
  </p>

  <h2>How It Works</h2>
  <p>
    When you open a webpage, your computer sends a request to a remote server using protocols like HTTP or HTTPS. That server responds with the content you asked for — text, images, videos, and more. These communications travel across networks of routers and switches that form the Internet’s backbone.
  </p>

  <h2>Major Components</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Servers:</strong> Store websites and data.</li>
    <li><strong>Routers:</strong> Direct traffic between networks.</li>
    <li><strong>ISPs:</strong> Internet Service Providers connect users to the global network.</li>
    <li><strong>Protocols:</strong> Rules that govern data exchange, like TCP/IP and DNS.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
  <p>
    The Internet has transformed education, communication, and business. It enables social connection, supports global collaboration, and powers everything from email to streaming to online learning.
