    <h2>Protecting Your Privacy</h2>
    <p>Your personal data, like your name, address, or photos, can be used by others if you share it online. Think before you post, and keep your accounts private when possible.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Don’t share your location publicly.</li>
      <li>Check who can see your posts on social media.</li>
      <li>Use two-factor authentication for extra protection.</li>
    </ul>

      <strong>Example:</strong> When signing up for a new website, check if it’s secure by looking for <b>https://</b> in the web address.
